## A Dockerized .NET API that interacts with a database containing the best selling Playstation 4 games. The database is a part of the docker container and exists as a volume.

### Must have Docker Desktop installed!!!
### In order to run the full system, please copy and paste the docker-compose.yaml file into your own directory or clone the repo. Then run docker compose up -d in the directory that the compose file is located. Once it is running, you can view the running container and access the local host port from the container on Docker Desktop. Alternatively, you can vist http://localhost:8080 when the container is running to access the API. Enjoy!!!
